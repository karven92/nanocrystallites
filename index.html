        <p><strong># INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>The study of nanometer sized crystallites helps us understand the evolution of collective characteristics of bulk materials from the discrete behaviour of molecular properties, which in turn may help us control this evolution to our benefits, given the different rates at which each bulk characteristic evolves. For example, non-linear optical effects from highly polarisable excited states and novel photochemical behaviour. Confinement of electronic and vibrational excitations due to spatial constraints, Quantum Confinement, wherein there is an increase in the HOMO-LUMO gap due to decrease in size which affects the electronic structure and photophysics of the nanoparticles is the dictator of physical properties of nanocrystallites [1]. Quantum Confinement can be achieved specifically or in combination of any of the three dimensions. Confinement in 1D gives Quantum Wells, in 2D gives Quantum Wires and in 3D gives Quantum Dots (QDs). As such, Quantum Confinement has numerous applications from Quantum Dot Sensitized Solar Cells (QDSSCs) to Quantum Light Emitting Devices (QLEDs). </p>


<p>QDs show notable characteristics that include tunability of band gap energy, narrow emission spectrum, good photostability, broad excitation spectra, high extinction coefficient and multiple exciton generation. The main motivation of using QDs as sensitizers is their size-tuneable energy band gap, which can control their absorption range. Vogel et al. demonstrated that efficient charge separation can be optimized by tuning the size of the QDs utilizing the quantization effect [2]. CdX (X=S, Se, Te) based QDs have become prominent due to their low cost, easy fabrication and high performance. It has been reported that lightly transition metal doped CdX QDs have enhanced photoluminescence (PL) properties of the QDs [3]. Also, it was seen that surface plasmon - exciton coupling in CdS QDs – Au thin film and CdSe QDs – Ag thin film resulted in enhanced photovoltaic efficiency [4, 5]. </p>
<p>Surface plasmons are electromagnetic waves that are trapped by collective oscillations of free electrons in a metal and that propagate along the metal surface. This trapping leads to an exponential decay in the electromagnetic field with respect to distance from the surface. The electromagnetic fields near metallic surfaces strongly affect the optical properties of nanocrystalline semiconductor materials. Thus, modifying the density of surface–plasmon states may enhance the absorptivity and the photoluminescence emission rate and increase quantum efficiency of semiconductor nanocrystals [4-6].</p>
<p>Large bandgap semiconductor oxide nanowires with tubular architecture are considered the most optimal geometry for facilitating better photogenerated charge separation and transport. Fabrication of a “Rainbow” solar cell consisting of QDs stacked inside a T_NT to absorb visible light was proposed recently, indicating that stacking QDs of different sizes shall allow maximum visible light absorbance thereby placing us in the vicinity of theoretically reachable quantum efficiencies. However, it is important to realize that this proposed increase in efficiency is not only due to broad absorption of sunlight by differential absorption from a mixture of quantum dots of varied sizes and bandgap energies, but also relies on the fact that when QDs with varied bandgaps are very closely packed in order of higher to lower bandgap energy, a QD of higher bandgap absorbs energy corresponding only to its bandgap and transmits the remaining lower energy to be absorbed by the next QD. Thereby, energy loss due to thermalization is avoided and harvesting of the broad visible spectrum of light can be realized. However, nanotubes of wide bandgap host oxides have dimension typically 103 times higher compared to the size of the QDs. Thus, the proposed architecture in this form (vertical stacking) is not practical due to the disparity in the scale of the deposited QDs and the host oxide nanowire. Radial stacking is a theoretically feasible idea, but not easy to achieve experimentally. Multi segmented semiconductor nanorods/nanowires with coupled electronic properties are reported and can be prepared by sequential VLS/SLS growth or ion exchange methods. Radial growth of these 1D nanostructures on oxide nanotubes can alleviate the problem of QD stacking and make a large stride towards “Rainbow” solar cell</p>
<p>In the present work, we synthesize CdSe QDs, study their excitonic and photoluminescence properties along with microscopic characterization, and then dope it with Au nanoparticles to study its effect on the optical properties of the QDs. We also synthesize TiO2 nanotubes and use Bi nanoparticles as nucleation sites for CdSe nanowires, as well as segmented CdS/CdSe nanowires with photoelectrochemical properties better than CdS or CdSe alone.</p>

<p><strong>## LITERATURE SURVEY</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Quantum Confinement in semiconductors</em></strong><br/>
Quantum confinement describes how the electronic properties - the organization of energy levels into which electrons can climb or fall - and optical properties change when the material sampled is in sufficiently small sizes - typically 12nm or less. Specifically, the phenomenon results from electrons and holes being squeezed into a dimension that approaches a critical quantum measurement, called the exciton Bohr radius. Holes are the positively-charge species left over when an electron vacates its position in a crystal. This quantum confinement is observed when the electron is bound by a set of energy or potential barriers.</p>
<p>When the size of the quantum dots is decreased, the gap between the valence band and the conduction band increases. It was found that by J.W Lee, D.Y Son et al. [7] that as the size of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) decrease, there is a blue shift in the absorption or the emission spectrum. Blue shift corresponds to decreasing wavelength or increasing energy whereas the Red shift corresponds to increasing wavelength.</p>
<p>When the semiconductors are energised by a photon or energy source, the electrons of valence band are excited to the conduction band. These electrons require energy equivalent to the band gap energy or higher to get excited to conduction band. This is the energy required to free the electrons from its bond and enable it to move and conduct. There exist discrete energy levels in an isolated atom whereas energy bands exist in solid. The free electrons in the conduction band and the holes present in the valence band are the charge carriers. On application of potential difference/electric field, the electron and hole move in different directions to generate a current.</p>
<p><strong>### Excitons</strong>
</p>

<p>It may so happen that the electrons remain bound to holes (like it is bound to protons in the nucleus of an atom) and create composite objects called Excitons. This electron and hole pair orbit each other and the radius of this orbit is Bohr exciton radius. It is the most fundamental excitation. These excitons are unable to move freely in a quantum confined SC.
Quantum dots exhibit quantum confinement when size of SC nanocrystals is close or smaller than the natural size of excitons. For CdSe crystals, as the size of QD decreases, the excitons get squeezed and wavelength of emission decreases. The excitons can be squeezed either by building very small size QDs or by engineering layers of SCs such that one layer is coated with another SC layer of different (usually smaller band gap).
</p>

<p>The squeezing of excitons in 1D is achieved in quantum wells, whereas in 2D it is achieved in nanowires and squeezing of excitons in 3D is achieved in quantum dots. 
</p>


<p><strong>### Interaction of metal nanoparticles with light</strong>
</p>

<p>It was observed from many experiments that when the size of the holes of a metal plate through which light is allowed to pass became smaller or comparable to the wavelength of incident light, then  the fraction of light transmitted is greater than the area of the holes. Sometimes, this fraction reached 100% at certain frequency. </p>

<p>They are standing on floating stones and are ready to board the ship. One extra floating stone is left vacant. The user has to make the New commander stand on the stone where he belongs and a small ferry is used for this purpose. The user is made to write an if statement to check if the i th element of the array,i.e, the i th commander’s skill set is smaller than his skill set or not. And if yes, then his position, the place where the commander should be inserted is marked, and a for loop is then introduced to check the above condition for all the elements. And then space is made by calling the transfer function which will be pre-defined and the Warrior inserted. All this is done using the user’s code.</p>

<p><em>Train Ride(Selection Sort)</em></p>

<p>The Next Part of the Journey has a train ride. But the problem with it is their size. The bogies are of different sizes and hence there travelling in accordance with their war skills have now become useless. The King now wishes to sort them in accordance with their sizes and hence make them enter their respective bogies as each bogie can accommodate only a single warrior. Now the King’s wizard creates a magic cloud which can change its size and an arrow head pointing at the first bogie initially and he takes the help of user’s swap function and uses it as a spell. He needs the user’s help in making the cloud find the lowest element amongst the Warriors, every time the cloud finds a Warrior smaller than it’s size it takes its shape and in the end, after checking all the elements, the user casts the "swap" spell. And swap that small Warrior with the Warrior at arrowhead position. And then the arrow head is moved and the above steps are repeated using a loop. And hence, they are sorted using Selection Sort Method</p>

<p><em>Insertion Sort (Horse Ride)</em></p>

<p>It’s getting late and the king has realised that if they go with this speed then they won’t be able to reach the safe zone before the sun sets. They have crossed the water body and have to ride horses in the next part of their journey. The horses are of different sizes and the Warriors of different heights. The King realises that he cannot help it now as the heights are not the same as their heights horses and hence asks the wizard ,i.e. the user to help him in making the Warriors ride on the horses provided. More importantly, this time he needs a faster method, than the one which was previously adopted. This is done using insertion sort, a sorting technique for an unsorted array. The user creates an imaginary partition and considers a part to be sorted,King first sends the first Warrior to the first horse and moves the second Warrior and position them according to their weights and then inserts the i th Warrior using the insertion technique or insertion spell and thus arranges them.here we use the insertion spell which we made in the second level.</p>

<p><em>Merge Sorting two Sorted Arrays</em></p>

<p>(<strong><em>StoryLine:</em></strong> In their journey few of the warriors fell sick , so they stop by a friendly country were they seek for help.The King of that country help them and agree to help our king by giving his warriors to our army.Now our next task is to sort warriors according to skillset from among both the army.)</p>

<p>This is the section where the user first plays the game and then understands it and writes the code himself/herself. The game contains a skill wise sorted army of two kingdoms, RED(our army) and BLUE(basically these are arrays). There' s a battle strip in between them and the two army's warriors(one from  each) reaches the strip then fights.The user has to compare the warriors skillset and the winner is made to sit on seat of honor(this is done by the user by adding that array element to final sorted array.). the looser warrior will fight with the next warrior of the other army. On completion of the above task, the user finds that the new army (Golden Army) this formed has members sorted ascendingly in order of their skill set and now they start moving towards the enemy's kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Merge Sort in a single Unsorted ray</em></p>

<p>(**<em>StoryLine:</em> **Next Challenge is for the golden army to travel to the final destination through a tunnel.The friendly king has old connected carriage, whose compartment are to be set in ascending order for maximum speed)</p>

<p>There is a swapping disc(which is operated with the swap spell from level 1) and track set to solve our challenge. Here is the rule that we always select the half the number of elements till and consider the left part and do the same till we get to the swap disc, where carriages are compared and swapped if necessary.After swap the carriages return back to their modified track positions(wizard will be guiding for the first two levels of merging).Once the finals half’s are sorted . the carriage is set to go!!!</p>

<p>With this i would end the first part of the journey teaching the user all the basic sorting algorithms.</p>

</h2>

<p><em><strong>StoryLine :</strong></em> The army reaches the enemy kingdom by dawn, there are number of paths with respective number of junctions to reach the gate of his kingdom , but army has to reach before sunrise. so with the help of the wizard the king and his army finds the shortest path.</p>

<p>All the warriors carry a bow and arrow which they tied a rope to know the distance it reached.
arena - Tower which have different paths to reach with number of nodes/junctions where we keep so called street lamps.
note : in this algorithm we first consider all the nodes to be at infinity.<br />
this.Throw(pos) - this will throw the anchor to the specifed position </p>
<p>Distance of that will show up on that street lamp (if the throw distance is less than the distance which is present on that lamp then throw will be failed)
we send a warrior to that node , who will wait for the kings order to move to the next junction
similarly we/king ask to fire to all the initial nodes by which we get the distance from intial point to all the first nodes.
next king will ask the a warrior to fire to the next node,as he fires distance of the next node will be know.
Here warrior standing at node will be considered as the visited node and the path throught which the warriors travelled will be highlighted
once a warrior reach the tower we shall hightlight the shortest path.</p>
