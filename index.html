<p>The study of nanometer sized crystallites helps us understand the evolution of collective characteristics of bulk materials from the discrete behaviour of molecular properties, which in turn may help us control this evolution to our benefits, given the different rates at which each bulk characteristic evolves. For example, non-linear optical effects from highly polarisable excited states and novel photochemical behaviour. Confinement of electronic and vibrational excitations due to spatial constraints, Quantum Confinement, wherein there is an increase in the HOMO-LUMO gap due to decrease in size which affects the electronic structure and photophysics of the nanoparticles is the dictator of physical properties of nanocrystallites [1]. Quantum Confinement can be achieved specifically or in combination of any of the three dimensions. Confinement in 1D gives Quantum Wells, in 2D gives Quantum Wires and in 3D gives Quantum Dots (QDs). As such, Quantum Confinement has numerous applications from Quantum Dot Sensitized Solar Cells (QDSSCs) to Quantum Light Emitting Devices (QLEDs). </p>


<p>QDs show notable characteristics that include tunability of band gap energy, narrow emission spectrum, good photostability, broad excitation spectra, high extinction coefficient and multiple exciton generation. The main motivation of using QDs as sensitizers is their size-tuneable energy band gap, which can control their absorption range. Vogel et al. demonstrated that efficient charge separation can be optimized by tuning the size of the QDs utilizing the quantization effect [2]. CdX (X=S, Se, Te) based QDs have become prominent due to their low cost, easy fabrication and high performance. It has been reported that lightly transition metal doped CdX QDs have enhanced photoluminescence (PL) properties of the QDs [3]. Also, it was seen that surface plasmon - exciton coupling in CdS QDs – Au thin film and CdSe QDs – Ag thin film resulted in enhanced photovoltaic efficiency [4, 5]. </p>
<p>Surface plasmons are electromagnetic waves that are trapped by collective oscillations of free electrons in a metal and that propagate along the metal surface. This trapping leads to an exponential decay in the electromagnetic field with respect to distance from the surface. The electromagnetic fields near metallic surfaces strongly affect the optical properties of nanocrystalline semiconductor materials. Thus, modifying the density of surface–plasmon states may enhance the absorptivity and the photoluminescence emission rate and increase quantum efficiency of semiconductor nanocrystals [4-6].</p>
<p>Large bandgap semiconductor oxide nanowires with tubular architecture are considered the most optimal geometry for facilitating better photogenerated charge separation and transport. Fabrication of a “Rainbow” solar cell consisting of QDs stacked inside a T_NT to absorb visible light was proposed recently, indicating that stacking QDs of different sizes shall allow maximum visible light absorbance thereby placing us in the vicinity of theoretically reachable quantum efficiencies. However, it is important to realize that this proposed increase in efficiency is not only due to broad absorption of sunlight by differential absorption from a mixture of quantum dots of varied sizes and bandgap energies, but also relies on the fact that when QDs with varied bandgaps are very closely packed in order of higher to lower bandgap energy, a QD of higher bandgap absorbs energy corresponding only to its bandgap and transmits the remaining lower energy to be absorbed by the next QD. Thereby, energy loss due to thermalization is avoided and harvesting of the broad visible spectrum of light can be realized. However, nanotubes of wide bandgap host oxides have dimension typically 103 times higher compared to the size of the QDs. Thus, the proposed architecture in this form (vertical stacking) is not practical due to the disparity in the scale of the deposited QDs and the host oxide nanowire. Radial stacking is a theoretically feasible idea, but not easy to achieve experimentally. Multi segmented semiconductor nanorods/nanowires with coupled electronic properties are reported and can be prepared by sequential VLS/SLS growth or ion exchange methods. Radial growth of these 1D nanostructures on oxide nanotubes can alleviate the problem of QD stacking and make a large stride towards “Rainbow” solar cell</p>
<p>In the present work, we synthesize CdSe QDs, study their excitonic and photoluminescence properties along with microscopic characterization, and then dope it with Au nanoparticles to study its effect on the optical properties of the QDs. We also synthesize TiO2 nanotubes and use Bi nanoparticles as nucleation sites for CdSe nanowires, as well as segmented CdS/CdSe nanowires with photoelectrochemical properties better than CdS or CdSe alone.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
